# Guess It

A game coded in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) where you have to guess a word based on its definition. The word is chosen from the 1000 most common words in the book *Thing Explainer: Complicated Stuff in Simple Words* by Randall Munroe, and the definitions are retrieved from the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

This project was created as part of an introductory course on functional programming.

## How to Play

1. Install [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).
2. Run the shell command `elm reactor` in the 'elm' folder (be sure not to run it from /src).
3. Go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser and click on 'Main.elm'.
4. To make a guess for the word, simply type it into the 'Write your guess' field.
